## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-08
### Added
- CI: dedicated `architecture` job running the structural-invariant tests on
  their own, so a layering violation surfaces as its own PR check.
- Brand guardrail: `tests/architecture/test_brand.py` fails if the app's token
  file drifts from the authoritative `design/tokens/tokens.css` (byte-identical).
- Brand guardrail: frontend `no-inline-hex` test fails if any hex colour literal
  appears in `apps/web/src` outside `styles/tokens.css`.
- ADR 0002: licensing recorded as provisional (MIT), with the triggers that would
  force a change and who decides.

### Changed
- `test_no_data_files_are_tracked` now checks git's index rather than the
  filesystem, so it passes with untracked real data present locally (required
  from phase 1) while still failing if data is ever committed.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-07
### Added
- Repository scaffold: src-layout Python package, monorepo directory structure.
- Tooling: uv, ruff, mypy (strict), pytest with coverage gate, pre-commit.
- CI: GitHub Actions for backend, frontend, and CodeQL.
- Docker Compose stack: TimescaleDB (Postgres 16 + PostGIS), Redis, api, web.
- Reason-code registry (R01-R21) seeded from the dataset profiling findings.
- Brand assets: the approved logo rebuilt as vectors (mark, small-size
  reduction, one-ink, horizontal and stacked lockups, app icon).
- Design tokens carrying the agreed Trust Blue / Sentinel Green / Alert Amber
  palette, unchanged by the logo. The mark's own artwork values are scoped
  separately as `--prov-brand-*` and are not usable in the interface.
- ADR 0001: monorepo and stack.
